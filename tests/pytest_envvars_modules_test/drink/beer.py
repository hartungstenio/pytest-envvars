Taste: Medium-high to very high hop bitterness is likely,
though the best of these beers will have enough of a malt
backbone to provide some balance. Hop flavor will be the
citrus, floral, fruity, piney and resinous qualities of
American hops, with certain flavors shining more than
others depending on hop selection.
